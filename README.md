# Tips for debugging a failed WRF simulation

This document is designed to aid in debugging a failed WRF simulation and
follows a typical workflow employed by staff in the Mesoscale and Microscale
Meteorology Lab at NCAR. The essential idea is to begin with a working
configuration of the model, and to incrementally change that configuration until
it fails in the same way as the original, failed simulation. In this way, it's
much easier to identify the specific cause for the failure.

How many lines will this wrap before we cannot type anymore and this becomes a complete mess? Any here I go, typing away, when will it wrap?
